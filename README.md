# MazeRoad
Game in google play(almoust(no))

In general, the main feature of this project is the generation of the road, 
that is, I didn’t want to make separate levels, so I decided to implement 
a rather difficult task for myself, which I completed in 3 days, everything 
seems to work the way I wanted, but there are a couple of points about which I will tell you now

The essence of the game was originally that instead of a ball, 
the player would control cars, but I had to put the car on the ground, 
and it destroyed the entire road system with its collider, so now the car is a ball.

The road needs work and a lot of colliders on one prefab

Also, for certain reasons, I can’t put the game on Google Play,
past projects have also disappeared from there, so if you’re interested, 
I can send them all via Google Drive, there are all my contacts in the profile
